#  How to reset an igt satellite slot machine without a key 

Satellite slot machines can be reset without a key, although the process is a bit more complicated than with key-operated machines. The first thing you'll need to do is remove the front panel of the machine. Once this is done, you'll see a large metal box in the center with several connectors on it. You'll also see a small hole on the right side of the box.

Next, you'll need to disconnect the power cord from the machine. Be very careful not to touch any of the connectors while doing this. Once the cord is disconnected, use a flathead screwdriver to remove the four screws that hold the metal box in place. Once these are removed, you can lift out the box and set it aside.

Now you'll see a green circuit board in the center of the machine. On either side of this board are two black cylinders called stepper motors. Use a pair of pliers to carefully twist each of these motors three or four times counterclockwise (they should turn easily).

Once both motors have been twisted, reattach the power cord to the machine and plug it in. Now you can reattach the front panel of the machine and start playing!
