#   LP Roulette: R25003 Buddy Knox.2. Samoa Price Check: Is the LP Roulette worth it? 

In this article, we're going to take a look at the LPRoulette R25003 Buddy Knox.2. Samoa, to see if it's worth the purchase price.

The first thing to consider is what the LP Roulette offers in terms of features. It has a stainless steel case and bracelet, Swiss automatic movement, anti-reflective sapphire crystal, and a 500M water resistance rating.

This is all great, but there are other watches out there that offer similar features for a lower price. So, the next question is: what makes the LP Roulette stand out from the competition?

Well, one thing that sets it apart is its unique design. It's definitely not your average watch, and that could be appealing to some people. It's also worth noting that the LP Roulette is made by a reputable company, which gives you some assurance of quality.

Ultimately, whether or not the LP Roulette is worth purchasing comes down to personal preference. If you like its unique design and you're confident in the company's reputation, then go ahead and buy it! Otherwise, there are plenty of other watches out there that offer similar features for less money.

# 3. Buddy Knox LP Roulette still up for grabs!

When Buddy Knox released his debut album in 1957, it shot to number one on the charts and made him an instant star. With such smash hits as "Party Doll" and "I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone," the album stayed at the top of the charts for months. His follow-up album, Roulette, was released in 1958 and fared equally well. With singles like "Hula Love" and "Rocky Road Blues," the album rocketed to number two on the charts and cemented Knox's place as one of rock 'n' roll's biggest stars.

Both albums were eventually remastered and re-released on CD, but collectors have long been searching for original copies of the Roulette LP. That may all soon change, however, as a copy of the album has just surfaced on eBay. The record is being sold by a collector in Manchester, England who says that he purchased it from a record store in Texas about 25 years ago.

The starting price for the album is Â£10,000 (about $15,000), but there is no telling how high it could go. This may be your last chance to own a piece of rock 'n' roll history, so don't miss out!

# 4. LP Roulette or not, this Buddy Knox track is killer!

It was early 1957 when Buddy Knox released his breakout single "Party Doll." The song shot to the top of the charts and made Knox a household name. While there were other songs that followed "Party Doll" that were successful, nothing ever quite matched the debut's chart-topping power.

A little over a year later, in 1958, Knox released another single, this time entitled "Lonely Petunia (LP Roulette)." Unlike "Party Doll," however, "LP Roulette" failed to make much of a dent on the charts. In fact, it's considered one of Knox's lesser-known songs.

But don't let that dissuade you from giving it a listen. Because even if it doesn't quite have the chart-topping power of "Party Doll," "LP Roulette" is still an excellent track that's worth your time.

The song has a nice rock 'n' roll beat that'll get your feet moving and has some great lyrics to match. For example, take this line from the song: "I'm like a cat in heat/I need love so bad." It's certainly not something you'd expect to hear in a Buddy Knox track, but that's what makes it so great.

If you're looking for a good rock 'n' roll song to get your groove on to, then be sure to check out "LP Roulette." You won't regret it!
