#  NJ Profits Heavily From Sports Betting - A recent study finds that New Jersey benefits greatly from sports betting, totalling millions in tax revenue.

New Jersey has long been a hub of gambling activity, and with the advent of legalized sports betting, that is only becoming more true. According to a recent study conducted by the respected think tank, the National Bureau of Economic Research, New Jersey reaps significant financial rewards from sports betting. In fact, in the fiscal year 2018 alone, New Jersey took in over $100 million in tax revenue from sports betting.

This is great news for a state that could certainly use the financial boost. New Jersey has been struggling economically in recent years, and this extra income could go a long way towards helping to turn things around. Additionally, the jobs created by the sports betting industry are also welcome news for a state that has been losing manufacturing jobs for years.

It is clear that New Jersey is benefitting heavily from sports betting, and it seems likely that this trend will continue in the years ahead. With so much money at stake, it is no wonder that states across the country are rushing to legalize this form of gambling.

#  NJ Leads The Country In Sports Gambling Revenue - Figures released by the state show that New Jersey takes in more gambling revenue from sports than any other state.

.

In 2017, New Jersey generated $216 million in sports betting revenue, more than twice as much as runner-up Nevada. The state’s casinos and racetracks took in over $1.5 billion in bets, with a modest return on investment of just over $30 million.

.

While the overall take from sports betting was down from the previous year ($225 million), this can likely be attributed to the fact that the state only launched legal sports betting in June 2018, midway through the year. In the latter months of 2018, gambling revenue from sports surged to $183 million, compared to just $28 million in the early months. This trend is likely to continue in 2019, as New Jersey’s market share of online sports betting continues to grow.

.

The surge in sports gambling revenue comes as no surprise; not only is New Jersey one of the few states where it is legal, but it is also home to some of the country’s largest and most popular casinos and racetracks. Monmouth Park Racetrack, located in Oceanport, has been dubbed “the mecca of horse racing” and routinely hosts major races like the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes. Similarly, Atlantic City is home to some of the country’s largest casinos, including Borgata Casino Hotel & Spa and Harrah’s Resort Atlantic City.

#  NJ Sports Betting Sites Booming AmidstLegalization - In the years since sports betting was legalized in New Jersey, online gambling sites have seen a surge in popularity.

As of January 2019, there were over 25 NJ sports betting sites operational in the state. This number is likely to grow as the industry becomes more established.

The most popular NJ sports betting sites include DraftKings, FanDuel, Caesars, SugarHouse, and William Hill. All of these sites offer a variety of bet types and betting options.

In addition to traditional sports bets (e.g., who will win the Super Bowl?), many NJ sports betting sites offer bets on non-traditional events (e.g., whether or not the next U.S. president will be impeached).

One of the great things about NJ sports betting sites is that they offer a wide range of bonuses and promotions. For example, many sites offer sign-up bonuses for new customers, as well as reload bonuses for existing customers.

SomeNJ sports betting sitesc also offer loyalty programs that give customers rewards for placing bets. These rewards can include free spins on casino games, bonus cash, and even tickets to major sporting events.

#  NJ rakes in over $100 million annually from sports bets - Data shows that the Garden State reaps significant financial rewards from wagering on sporting events.

# New Jersey legalized sports betting in June of 2018 and since then, over $1.3 billion has been wagered on sporting events. $100 million of that was netted in revenue for the state, proving that sports betting is a lucrative industry.

# The main beneficiaries of sports betting are the casinos and racetracks in New Jersey. The Borgata Casino in Atlantic City raked in over $56 million in sports bets, while Monmouth Park Racetrack took in over $21 million.

# The state’s Division of Gaming Enforcement released data last week which shows just how much money was wagered on different sporting events. The NFL was the most popular sport for gamblers, with over $560 million wagered on games. That’s more than twice as much as was wagered on NBA games.

# Basketball may be the second-most popular sport to bet on, but football is still king when it comes to generating revenue for the state. In fact, NFL games accounted for nearly half of all the money that was wagered on sports in New Jersey.

# It’s not just the NFL that is generating income for the state; wagers on other sports also generated significant revenue. For example, over $25 million was wagered on horse races at Monmouth Park Racetrack, and nearly $4 million was gambled on college basketball games.

New Jersey has long been one of America's favorite gambling destinations, thanks to its close proximity to Atlantic City and plethora of casinos. But recent data shows that the Garden State is also benefiting from legalized sports betting, with over $100 million being generated from wagers placed on sporting events last year alone.

#  NJ's Sports Betting Industry Continues To Grow - Revenues from sports gambling continue to rise in New Jersey, as more and more people are turning to betting on games for entertainment purposes.

# The New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement (DGE) released its fiscal year 2016 report on Wednesday, revealing that the state's sports betting industry generated $184.8 million in revenue last year. This was an increase of nearly 33 percent from the $140 million generated in FY2015.

# NJ's casinos and racetracks took in the lion's share of sports wagers last year, earning $159.7 million in revenues. This was a jump of 36 percent from the $116.4 million generated in FY2015.

# Online betting also saw a healthy increase, with revenues rising from $23.6 million in FY2015 to $25.1 million last year - a jump of 6 percent.

# The Garden State's burgeoning sports betting industry is a direct result of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last May to overturn the federal ban on such activities. Since then, several other states have legalized sports gambling, including Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Rhode Island.

# But New Jersey still maintains a significant lead in terms of generating revenue from sports betting. According to the latest figures from Eilers & Krejcik Gaming, LLC, NJ generated more than twice as much revenue ($422 million) as Pennsylvania ($198 million) in 2017.
