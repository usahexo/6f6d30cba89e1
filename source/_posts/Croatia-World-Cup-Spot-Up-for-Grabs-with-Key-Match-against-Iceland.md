#  Croatia World Cup Spot Up for Grabs with Key Match against Iceland

The Croatia national football team is in a precarious position as they head into their final World Cup qualifying match against Iceland. With a win necessary to ensure their spot in next year's tournament, the pressure is on for Zlatko Dalic's side.

They have not had an easy road to this point, with narrow wins over Kosovo and Turkey, as well as a hard-fought draw against Ukraine. Iceland, on the other hand, has looked impressive in qualification thus far, with convincing wins over Finland and Turkey.

This match is shaping up to be a do-or-die clash for Croatia, and they will need to be at their best if they hope to come out on top. Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic are two of the key players that will need to be firing on all cylinders if Croatia are going to make it to Russia.

The Icelandic defence has been tough to break down so far in qualifying, so Dalic will need to find a way to unlock them if his side is going to come away with three points. A win would also see them leapfrog Iceland in the group standings, which would be an important psychological boost ahead of the playoffs.

All eyes will be on Zagreb on Monday night as Croatia looks to clinch a spot at the World Cup.

#  Croatia Looking to Bounce Back After Sloppy Start to the Tournament

Croatia started the 2018 World Cup tournament in Russia with a sloppy 2-2 draw against Nigeria. The Croatians have yet to win a game in regulation time in their last five World Cup appearances.

The Croatia squad features Real Madrid midfielder Luka Modric, Barcelona's Ivan Rakitic, and Juventus striker Mario Mandzukic. The midfield trio is expected to lead Croatia's attack against Argentina in their second group stage game.

Argentina enters the match as the heavy favorites, however, Croatia will be looking to pull off an upset victory. A win against Argentina would give Croatia some much needed confidence as they continue to compete in the tournament.

#  England Looks to End Croatia's World Cup Dreams

England will take on Croatia in their semifinal match on Wednesday, July 11th with the hopes of making it to their first World Cup final since 1966. England had a relatively easy path to the semifinals, cruising past Tunisia, Panama, and Sweden in the group stage before knocking out Colombia in the Round of 16 and then defeating Iceland 2-1 in the quarterfinals. Croatia, on the other hand, had a much more difficult road to the semifinals. They tied Denmark 1-1 in the group stage before ousting Argentina 3-0 in the Round of 16 and Brazil 2-1 in the quarterfinals.

This will be only the second meeting between England and Croatia. The first meeting was in 2008, with Croatia winning 2-0. This match is sure to be a thrilling one as both teams have shown they are capable of playing some very exciting soccer.

England is led by captain Harry Kane, who is currently the leading scorer in this year's World Cup with six goals. Other key players for England include midfielders Dele Alli and Jesse Lingard as well as defender John Stones.

Croatia is led by midfielder Luka Modric, who is considered one of the best midfielders in the world. Other key players for Croatia include midfielder Ivan Rakitic and forwards Mario Mandzukic and Ante Rebic.

This match will likely come down to which team can control possession and create more scoring opportunities. Both teams are very good defensively so it may be difficult for either team to score more than one goal. In the end, I believe that England will come out on top and will advance to their first World Cup final since 1966.

#  Luka Modric Leads Croatia into Battle Against England

This is the biggest game of the 2018 World Cup.

England, who cruised through qualification undefeated, will take on Croatia in a match that will decide who goes to the final.

Luka Modric has been a revelation in this tournament for Croatia, and he will be looking to lead his country to their first ever World Cup final.

For England, they will rely on captain Harry Kane to lead them to victory. Kane has been in excellent form, and he will be looking to add to his tally of six goals so far in the World Cup.

It is sure to be an exciting match, and it is difficult to know who will come out on top. However, with Luka Modric in such fine form, Croatia certainly have a chance of victory.

#  Can Croatia Upset England and Advance in the World Cup?

England will be looking to make it out of the group stage of the World Cup and move on to the next round, but they may have some trouble with Croatia. Croatia is a very good team, and they could easily upset England if they're not careful.

England is coming into this game after a solid performance in their first match against Tunisia. They were able to win 2-1, and that should give them some confidence heading into this matchup. However, they'll need to be careful against Croatia, as they are a very good team.

Croatia is coming into this game after a loss to Argentina. They were really unlucky in that match, as they had a number of chances to score but just couldn't convert them. That loss should motivate them heading into this matchup though, and they'll be looking to get revenge on England.

This should be a very good game between two evenly matched teams. It's tough to know who will come out on top, but it should be an exciting match to watch either way.
