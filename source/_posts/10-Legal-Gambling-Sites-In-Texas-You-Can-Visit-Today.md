#  Houston, Dallas Among Cities Allowing Gambling

Houston, Dallas and a few other Texas cities will soon be allowing gambling after state lawmakers voted to legalize casino gambling in the state. The bill, which was narrowly approved in the House of Representatives, now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, who is expected to sign it into law.

The new law would allow up to 10 casinos to be built in Texas. While specifics have yet to be ironed out, the casinos are expected to be located in Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin, San Antonio and Lake Charles, Louisiana.

Supporters of the measure say that it will bring much-needed revenue to the state, with analysts estimating that it could generate as much as $1.4 billion per year. They also argue that it will create jobs and help tourism.

Opponents of the measure, meanwhile, warn that it could lead to addiction and other social ills. They also note that there is no guarantee that the new casinos will benefit Texas taxpayers, as many of them may instead simply choose to gamble online or cross state lines to visit casinos in other states.

No matter where one stands on the issue of casino gambling, it is clear that the debate is far from over. In fact, it is likely just the beginning as more states consider legalizing this form of gaming.

#  Texas Lawmakers Considering Bill To Legalize Slot Machines At Racetracks

A proposed bill in the Texas legislature would legalize slot machines at horse racing tracks across the state.

House Bill 822, put forward by Republican Representative Wayne Faircloth, is designed to help struggling racetracks stay afloat by boosting revenue from gambling. Faircloth told reporters that the measure would create jobs and help the horse racing industry attract new fans.

The bill has been met with some opposition, however, with opponents arguing that it would lead to more gambling addiction and other social problems.

Texas is one of only a few states in the US that does not currently allow slot machines at racetracks. If the proposed bill is passed, it could provide a major boost to the state's horse racing industry.

#  San Antonio Could See Gambling Boom If Proposals Pass Legislature

The state of Texas could see a gambling boom in the near future, as two proposals that would legalize various forms of gambling have been making their way through the state legislature.

One proposal, House Bill 2143, would legalize casinos in Texas. The other, Senate Bill 790, would legalize sports betting.

Both bills have passed their respective chambers of the legislature and are now awaiting a vote from the governor.

If either bill is signed into law, it would likely lead to a gambling boom in San Antonio. This is because San Antonio is located close to the Texas-Mexico border, and is therefore well-positioned to take advantage of the new gambling opportunities that would be made available by the bills.

In addition to casinos and sports betting, both bills would also legalize online gambling. This could lead to a surge in online gambling traffic from San Antonio residents.

Gambling is already popular in San Antonio, with horse racing and casinos being among the most popular forms of gambling. If House Bill 2143 or Senate Bill 790 are signed into law, this popularity is likely to increase even further.

#  New Laws Passed In Texas Include The Legalization Of Gambling


On Tuesday, June 12th, the Texas Legislature passed a new set of laws that will go into effect on September 1st. This new legislation includes the legalization of gambling in the state. While many Texans are excited about this new development, others are concerned about the potential negative effects that legalized gambling could have on the community.

One of the main reasons that lawmakers gave for legalizing gambling was to help generate additional revenue for the state. It is estimated that this new form of taxation could bring in as much as $1.5 billion per year. Some of this money will be used to fund education and infrastructure projects, while some will be set aside for gambling addiction prevention and treatment programs.

Gambling is already widely available in Texas, but it has been taking place illegally in unlicensed casinos and through online betting sites. With the passage of this new law, these activities will now be legal and regulated by the state. This is expected to bring in additional revenue through taxes, as well as create jobs in the casino industry.

While there are many benefits to legalizing gambling, there are also some potential risks that need to be considered. Critics of gambling argue that it can lead to addiction and financial hardship for those who participate in it. They also worry that it could contribute to crime and social problems in our communities.

It will be important to monitor the effects of legalized gambling on Texas communities and make sure that adequate resources are available to prevent and treat addiction. With responsible regulation, however, I believe that legalized gambling can be a positive addition to our state economy and provide us with much-needed revenue for important projects.
