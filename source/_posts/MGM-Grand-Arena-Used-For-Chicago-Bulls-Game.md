#  Construction Of The Venetian Las Vegas Was Used For A Chicago Bulls Game

The Venetian Las Vegas was completed in 1999 at a cost of $1.5 billion, making it the most expensive resort hotel ever built at the time. The Venetian is one of only two resorts on the Las Vegas Strip with both a hotel and a casino. The Venetian is also the largest hotel in the world, with over 7,000 rooms.

The Venetian was originally built as part of Steve Wynn’s bid to create a “destination resort” in Las Vegas. Wynn had previously opened the Mirage Resort in 1989 and was looking for a new project. He purchased property on the Las Vegas Strip and hired architects to design a new resort hotel.

Wynn wanted to include a canal reminiscent of Venice, Italy, so he commissioned replica gondolas and canals to be built on the property. However, construction of the canals proved difficult and ended up costing twice as much as planned. The canals were eventually filled in and replaced with flooring that matches the rest of the casino.

The Venetian was originally scheduled to open in February 1999, but construction delays pushed back the opening date to August 1999. The resort was officially opened by Wynn and actor James Woods on August 28, 1999.

One of the first major events held at the Venetian was a Chicago Bulls game on October 18, 1999. The Bulls played two preseason games against the Sacramento Kings at the Venetian as part of their 1999-2000 season tour.

#  Wynn Las Vegas Casino Used For Chicago Bulls Game

Wynn Las Vegas Casino was used for the Chicago Bulls game on October 10, as the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino was being used for a convention. The game marked the season opener for the Bulls and they played against the Oklahoma City Thunder.

The casino didn't have any issues with the game, as it went smoothly. There were some concerns about having the game at the casino, as there wasn't a lot of time to set everything up. However, the Wynn staff was able to get everything done in time for the game.

There were some changes that had to be made to accommodate the game, such as covering up all of the slot machines and adding more than 1,000 temporary seats. There was also added security for the event, as well as additional food and beverage service.

The casino did a good job of hosting the event and it seemed that everyone had a good time. The Bulls ended up winning the game 100-95.

This was the first time that the Bulls played at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino. They faced the Golden State Warriors, who are one of the best teams in the NBA.

The game started out very close, with each team scoring baskets early on. However, the Warriors eventually pulled ahead and ended up winning by a score of 112 to 94.

Despite the loss, the experience of playing at the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino was a great one for the Bulls. The venue is very new and features excellent amenities, such as a large casino, several restaurants, and a luxury spa.

Overall, the Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino was an excellent host for the Chicago Bulls and provided them with a great experience. If you are looking for a place to stay in Las Vegas or want to enjoy some good casino games, then this is definitely a place to check out.

#  Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino Was The Home of The Chicago Bulls

In the early 1990s, the Chicago Bulls were one of the most popular teams in the NBA, and their fans were eager to see them play live. So when it was announced that the Bulls would be playing a preseason game against the Magic Johnson-led Los Angeles Lakers at the newly opened Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas, tickets sold out quickly.

The matchup between the two teams was highly anticipated, and many celebrities were in attendance, including Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, and Demi Moore. The Lakers ended up winning the game 112-103, but that didn't dampen the spirits of the Bulls' fans who had a great time at Planet Hollywood.

The hotel and casino would go on to become a popular destination for sports fans, as it was also home to the Los Angeles Kings (NHL), San Diego Padres (MLB), and Las Vegas Golden Knights (NHL) during their inaugural seasons. In addition to sporting events, Planet Hollywood also hosted concerts by some of the biggest names in music, including U2, Britney Spears, Janet Jackson, and Celine Dion.
