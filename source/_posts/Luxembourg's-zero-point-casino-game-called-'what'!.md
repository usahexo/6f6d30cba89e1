#  Luxembourg's zero-point casino game called 'what'!

In Luxembourg, there's a casino game called "what." It's played with dice and each player starts out with zero points. The goal of the game is to score points by rolling the dice and taking the highest score possible. However, you can only score points if your total score is higher than the other player's score. If your total score is lower than the other player's, then you lose points instead. The first player to reach 1000 points or more wins the game.

Here's an example of how to play "what." Let's say that Player A has a total score of 620 points, while Player B has a total score of 980 points. In this case, Player A would lose 360 points (980 - 620), while Player B would gain 360 points (620 + 980). The first player to reach 1000 or more points would then be the winner.

#  Casino game with zero points called 'what' in Luxembourg!

A new casino game has been introduced in Luxembourg – Casino du Lac-Leamy (CLL) in Gatineau, Quebec, Canada. The game is called 'what' and it has zero points.

The rules are simple: each player is dealt four cards, face down. The dealer flips one card over to start the turn. Each player must then say 'what' or 'pass'. If you say 'what', you either must put one of your other cards down on the table, or take the revealed card into your hand.

If you pass, then you keep your four cards and the next player flips over a card. If the revealed card is lower than the first card, then that player takes another turn; if it's higher, the previous player still takes another turn. When someone either puts a card down or takes a revealed card into their hand, they end their turn by flipping over the next card. The game ends when both players have no cards left and whoever has the highest total score (sum of all four cards) wins!

In order to make things more exciting, some casinos are offering side bets. For example, if you put down a side bet of $5 and get a pair of kings or better as your four cards, then you would win $25.
